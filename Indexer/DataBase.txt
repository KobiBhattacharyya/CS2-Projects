../fish/ Kingdom Animalia; Phylum: Chordata Chordates, Subphylum: Vertebrata Vertebrates Class: Bony Fish Osteichtyes, Pisces The exact number of fishes cannot be specified. There are approximately 22 000 different species and scientists are still sorting them out. Anatomy: Fishes are superbly designed for the water life while water covers about 71 % of the earth�s surface. Their skin is mucous and it is made of scales whose design and shape vary a lot. The majority of fishes have got a skeleton made of bones. The spine is made of vertebrae. Ribs are made from the lateral vertebrae prominences. These ribs stabilize the ventral side and protect inner organs as well. There are tiny bones being created in the paired fins area breast and ventral fins. From the evolutionary point of view, these small bones are a base for future extremities. Apart from that, the breast fins are a base for future shoulderblade and the ventral fins are a base for future pelvic area. It is obvious that neither the shoulderblade area nor the pelvic area are fixed to the spine. Both of them are fixed only to muscles and ligaments. Physiology: The fishes spend their life in the water. They breathe with gills which contain a number of tiny blood vessels and capillaries. These are well protected. Heart of a fish has got two parts: an atrium and a ventricle. The blood from the ventricle flows to an artery which divides into the small ones. These small arteries bring blood to the gills where the blood is oxygenated. Then it flows to the spine artery which divides and subsequently brings blood containing inevitable oxygen to particular organs. Deoxygenated blood from all organs is then collected from all veins to the main one. Last but not least the main vein brings deoxygenated blood to the atrium. This is how blood simply circulates in the fish�s body. Few fishes have got primitive lungs. Digestion is simple as well. Fish�s mouth may contain a huge variety of teeth which kill a prey and crush it. Then it follows to the pharynx and esophagus oesophagus. Distal/Aboral oesophagus part is wider and it is followed by a stomach gaster, ventriculus. Intestine intestinum is not very differentiated. In the ventral esophagus area there is a sack filled with gas. The gas pressure can be changed. The brain consists of five parts. The most peculiar thing about fish is definitely the �sideline�. It is located on the lateral side of the fish�s body. It contains a number of sensory and very sensitive nerves. These nerves enable fish to orientate themselves when it is dark and in murky water. Other sensory organs include eyes, smell organ etc. We can divide fishes into several categories. In the first category there are fishes which live in the fresh water for instance Lepidosiren. They are able to breathe either with gills or with lung sacks as well. The second category contains extinct fishes. Latimera chalumnae is probably the only surviving fish at this time. The third category is a huge one. It contains fishes which inhabits seas and oceans but freshwater as well. Their fins are made of rayshaped bones. In Europe we can find for example: Cyprinus carpio Carp, Tinca tinca, Chondrostoma nasus, Leuciscus cephalus, Salmo Salmon, Essox Pike, Barbus barbus, Perca fluviatilis and so on. The size of the fishes varies a lot. For instance The Whale shark measures up to 19 m whereas the Luzon Goby only 11 mm. Eating habits are different as well. Some fish feed on meat a number of sharks, piranhas whereas other ones feed on plankton, insects etc. carps. Some fish inhabit sea rays and on the other hand there are only freshwater fish such as trout. Apart from that for instance salmons inhabit both types of the water throughout their lives.

atlanticneedlefish.php Atlantic Needlefish  Strongylura marina  Atlantic Needlefish  Atlantic Needlefish information  Atlantic Needlefish facts As the name reveals, The Atlantic Needlefish is found in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Its habitat ranges from the state of Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. It spends most of the time close to the water surface or in the shallow water from where it often jumps when following its prey. Strongylura marina is a needleshaped fish with slim and silver coloured skin. Its length is about 1.2 metres 4 feet. Its jaw is immensely strong and long full of razorsharp teeth. After the birth their lower part of the jaw is longer than the upper one. But this changes soon after the birth. Its diet consists mostly of surfaceliving fishes, then invertebrates, crustaceans, squids etc. The breeding is similar to the flying fishes. They lay tiny, roundshaped eggs which are covered with long filaments. These filaments attach them to the water plants. The Atlantic Needlefish is a true water predator. It is not unusual to see it jumping off the water when trying to catch a fast moving fish. Its strong and sharp jaw has already caused many injuries to divers and to swimmers as well. There are also some reports of needlefishes that were stabbing into the fisherman�s boat. When being caught it �flies� above the water surface in order to get rid of the hook. By these attempts it often hurts itself a lot.

bullshark.php Bull Shark  Carcharhinus leucas  Bull Shark  Bull Shark information  Bull Shark facts The Bull shark is found in tropical as well as in subtropical seas especially along the shores all around the world. The body shape of this omnivorous animal is undoubtedly remarkable. And that is because Carcharhinus leucas is much wider in comparison to its length than any other sharks. Its wide snout makes this shark so unique. It has got grey colour with bright stripes on the both sides of its extraordinary shaped body. The male sharks are over 7 feet long weighing about 95 kg while the female sharks are up to 12 feet long weighing 240 kg on average. The Bull shark eats fish including other sharks preferably small Sandbar sharks, turtles, rays, birds, dolphins, molluscs, herrings and other water animals. Carcharhinus leucas reaches sexual maturity at the age of 10 years. Generally they breed during summer giving birth to the live young as they are viviparous approximately 1 year later. They are up to 30 inches long. The Bull sharks are not migratory animals. In spite of that they have been found in the freshwater too. They are the only sharks, which are able to survive for a certain period of time in the freshwater. They also belong to the most commonly caught sharks in the world, mainly because of their meat and skin.
cohosalmon.php Coho Salmon  Oncorhynchus kisutch  Coho Salmon  Coho Salmon information  Coho Salmon facts Salmons are spread in the North America, Asia and other areas all around the world. They are found in fresh water during the first year of their lives and later on when spawning. After the first year they move to the ocean and grow rapidly because of the abundance of food. They usually have silver colour which gets darker when spawning and males develop a red line on the sides and a hooked jaw. Their weight is from 6 to 12 pounds and they can be up to 37 inches long. In freshwater they eat insects, worms, small water animals and fish including salmons and trouts. Once they reach the ocean their diet mostly consists of other fish such as herrings etc. Approximately at the age of 3, sexually matured salmons swim to the natal place in the freshwater. Over there the female salmon digs a nest and lays her eggs. Consequently the male salmon fertilizes them and then they are buried. After 8 weeks, larvae hatch and stay in the freshwater for about a year. Then they move to the ocean and the whole cycle is repeated again. Salmons together with trouts are mainly known for their delicious meat and can be cooked many ways. Fishing for them is a very favourite sport and an exciting experience as well.
cuiucuiu.php Cuiu Cuiu  Pseudodoras Niger or Oxydoras Niger  Cuiu Cuiu  Cuiu Cuiu information  Cuiu Cuiu facts The Cuiu Cuiu fish is located in South America. It inhabits the Amazon, the Orinoco as well as the Parana River System. This fish prefers freshwater and large rivers with the temperature of 20 �C27 �C, but its body can tolerate temperatures ranging from 1930 �C. It has got dark colour ranging from jet black to dark brown. It is about 60 cm 24 inches long. Its eyes are on the sides of its body and on the back half of its head. Pseudodoras Niger is an insectivore however it gets its nutrition even from snails, seeds, fruits, crustaceans, pees, earthworms etc. depending on the place it lives. The Cuiu Cuiu takes part in an annual massive upstream migration which lasts approximately four months. It usually starts after spawning in June when water level is decreased. Unfortunately there is not any specific information about its reproduction cycle. Pseudodoras Nigra is a very important fish on the market as many people eat it especially in Latin America. It is also a host to many parasitic nematodes therefore we have to be very careful when preparing it as a meal.
electriceel.php Electric Eel  Electrophorus electricus  Electric Eel  Electric Eel information  Electric Eel facts The Electric eel is truly a remarkable animal not only from the biological but also from the physical point of view. It is the only animal which can make an electric discharge of approximately 500 Volts. It is spread in the South America in Guianas then in the Orinoco and the Amazon basin. There it inhabits fast moving waters. It has got long and rounded body with small eyes. Its colour is dark brown. The eel can be up to 2.4 m 8 feet long. The electric eel does not have any pelvic, dorsal or tail fin. Because of that its swimming can also be called as wriggling because its movements are made by the anal fin. An adult eel feeds on small fishes and young eels eat insects. The most interesting feature on this electric fish is its electric organs. Electrophorus electricus has got three of them. These unique organs are made of electroplates which are located in rows. These electroplates are serial connected which means that even a small electrical output may be increased several times because these electric outputs are summed. Consequently, at the end the electric output is strong enough to kill a small fish or to make an injury to a human being. By causing this electric shock the electric eels get their food. Despite all of that these electric organs have another function as well. They also emit electric pulses. On the eel�s skin there are a number of electric sensors which are able to detect these signals back. This is the way how the electric eels orientate themselves in the water and also communicate between one another. The dominant male eel emits the loudest, the noisiest and the most frequent signals whereas the female eels emit short lasting signals. These electric features were firstly studied by C.W. Coated of the New York Aquarium in 1920s. However the first report about this fascinating animal was made by a Frenchman J. Richter in 1729.

europeaneel.php European Eel  Anguilla Anguilla  European Eel  European Eel information  European Eel facts The European Eel is a peculiar fish. Its colour varies from brown to silver depending on the stage of life the eel undergoes. Its length is approximately 100 cm 40 in and its weight is up to 9 kg 20 lb. Anguilla anguilla has got a massive distribution all around Europe ranging from Scandinavia to Spain, Italy and Greece. It was also found in the northern parts of Africa. Its swimming skills are doubtful as its rounded body only wriggles in the water. It spends its life usually on the river bottom hiding in the mud or in small gaps in the rocks. Its diet consists of small fishes, carrion and water invertebrates. The European Eel�s life can be divided into several periods including larval and postlarval period. They also migrate to the Atlantic Ocean, where the female eel lays her eggs. At the age of 3 years, the baby eels migrate from the Atlantic Ocean upstream into Europe. Their life span is about 30 years in the wild and approximately 60 years in captivity. The female ells tend to live longer.

It is spread in the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. Despite its wide distribution it is very rare to see this shark. Therefore there is only little information about this fish. Its length is over 3.4 metres and its colour is light brown. Mitsukurina Owstoni has got rather flattened body, pretty long and a sharp snout and powerful jaws. Its eyes are very small however on the snout and in the jaw area there are plenty of other sensory organs. There is insufficient information about its diet. Biologists suppose it can feed on small fishes, shrimps and squids. The Goblin sharks lives in waters as deep as 555 m 1820 ft. It is supposed it gives birth to living young.

Grab your copy now for only $17.77 Originally the goldfish come from China but these days they can be found everywhere from slowmoving waters, through freshwaters, rivers, ponds, lakes to indoor aquariums and pools. Generally they prefer freshwater which is quite murky with the temperature ranging from 0 to 30 degrees Celsius 32 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit. The Goldfish is approximately 41 cm 16 inches long and weighs about 3 kg 6.6lb. Its appearance depends on location, food, temperature and other factors. Generally it has got paired pectoral and pelvic fins with one dorsal, caudal and anal fin. There is only a subtle difference between the male and the female fish. As it is omnivorous its diet consists of plants, plankton, detritus, insects, peas, lettuce, worms, larvae, small birds, tiny mammals, reptiles and amphibians. The reproduction cycle is quite typical. It begins when the males start to chase the females. Later on the female fish lays couple of thousand eggs. The breeding occurs all year round in indoor pools/aquariums on the other hand in nature it occurs mostly in summer. There is no parental care. Carassius auratus is sexually mature at the age of 2 however this highly depends on water temperature, sufficient nutrition and other environmental factors. Its life span is about 25 years when kept in a pond. The Goldfish tend to live in groups. They should not be released into the water in nature, because they can breed very quickly and consequently they can crowd out native fish population. They are considered to be pests for other fish population. Understandably they also have got their predators such as herons, turtles and so on. They are used as aquarium fish, but also as a bait for fishermen.
greatbarracuda.php Great Barracuda  Sphyraena barracuda  Great Barracuda  Great Barracuda information  Great Barracuda facts Sphyraena barracuda can be found almost in all warm seas. It is also found in tropical areas of the Pacific as well as of the Atlantic Ocean. It prefers water temperature about 75 degrees of Fahrenheit but can be also found in colder waters. Its length usually does not exceed 2 metres and its weight is about 40 kg. Its agile silver coloured body has got 2 dorsal fins, large scales and large mouth with many exceptionally sharp teeth just suitable for biting. On its body there are several dark spots however there is no obvious difference between the male fish and the female one. The Great Barracuda is piscivorous, which means it eats other fish for instance: sardines, silversides, mullets, gobies, herrings but also small lizards and dolphins. Barracuda�s reproduction still remains unclear, but we know that the spawning takes place in spring. Its fertilized eggs are left with no care at all. It is a solitary fish and can be found in groups only when younger. The Barracuda might be a dangerous fish especially when provoked. Its sharp knifelike teeth have already caused a number of injuries to divers and swimmers. Barracuda�s meat can contain a poison so it is dangerous to eat it. It is also illegal to sell this fish. Nevertheless some people find its meat tasty.
greathammerheadshark.php Great Hammerhead Shark  Sphyrna mokarran  Great Hammerhead Shark  Great Hammerhead Shark information  Great Hammerhead Shark facts The Great hammerhead shark is one of the most unique and bizarre sea predators all around the world. Its flattened head with the eyes and nostrils situated on the far sides of the head, wide mouth full of extremely sharp triangular teeth make this shark one of the most frightening animals in the water. There are several theories explaining why its head is so flattened. The first one sees the reason in stability while swimming. On the other hand the long distance between the nostrils and the eyes enable shark to find food quite easily as the sight and smell are much broader. Its colour may vary from olive green to grey colour above and white colour below. Its length is usually 3.5 m 11.5 feet but occasionally 6 metres long sharks were observed. Their average weight is 770 kg 1700 lb. Sphyrna mokarran is distributed in all tropical and some subtropical waters worldwide. It inhabits coastal areas of the continent, offshore islands, but can be found in the open sea as well. These sharks are solitary hunters but some schools of sharks have been reported migrating to the north or south depending on the time of the year. Their diet consists of small skates, stingrays, small sharks and also sea catfish. When measuring over 3 metres they reach sexual maturity. They are viviparous, giving birth to 2040 young. These are born usually during summer time measuring up to 70 cm while their heads are more rounded compared to the adult sharks. This will however change as they grow. All in all, the Great Hammerhead shark is a unique water creature which can be very dangerous to humans. It is also caught mainly because of its skin often used for leather.
greatwhiteshark.php Great White Shark  Carcharodon carcharias  Great White Shark  Great White Shark information  Great White Shark facts The Great white shark is a true sea predator. Its aerodynamic shaped body with halfmoon shaped tail enable it to reach high speeds in a moment and on the other hand it is also able to migrate at a steady speed of 2 mph 3.2 km per hour for many days. Its length is approximately 8 metres and the weight may be above 2 000 kg. It has got a perfect sense of smell especially for blood. Its sharp and triangular teeth located in a powerful jaw can bite almost everything including a surfboard or even a small boat. Its colour is light grey with white underside. This shark inhabits all tropical and warm seas. There it mostly finds food in the shallow waters. Its diet consists of all water animals such as seals, dolphins, small whales, sea lions, seals, sea otters, turtles, porpoises, squids but also small sharks and sea birds. There is insufficient information about its reproduction but it is supposed that the female shark gives birth to live young. Carcharodon carcharias is a solitary animal and only rarely is found in pairs or small groups. There are several reports that it attacked surfers, divers or fishermen. Most of these reports are exaggerated. Generally the white sharks attack surfers because the silhouette of a surfer on a surfboard is similar to a water animal. However, after biting into the human�s body the sharks usually leave it.
hornshark.php Horn Shark  Heterodontus francisci  Horn Shark  Horn Shark information  Horn Shark facts The Horn shark can be found in the eastern Pacific, where it inhabits temperate and subtropical areas by the coast. Its length ranges from 100 to 120 cm with the weight of about 10 kg. It belongs to the smaller sharks. It has got brown coloured body with dark spots on it, small head and ridges above the eyes. Heterodontus francisci feeds on fishes, invertebrates, molluscs, crustaceans etc. Although it belongs to the small size sharks it is not very agile and it is rather inactive. It waits for its prey generally during the night as it is a nocturnal animal and it is often found having a rest in between the rocks. The mating process usually occurs in December or in January. The male shark finds the female shark and inserts a clasper in her cloaca. Few weeks after copulation, which lasts less than an hour, the female shark lays her fertilised eggs. New young are born after approximately 8 months. The Horn shark does not belong to endangered species. It is a very peaceful and no aggressive shark which will flee if a person or a big fish come closer. It is also very useful in research for carrying out experiments as it can survive in captivity for many years in comparison to other sharks.

In front of the head it has got two cephalic lobes. In the mouth there are plenty of teeth located only in the lower jaw. Despite the teeth presence this ray does not need them for eating. Its colour may vary from black to grey. It measures 30 feet in length with a short tail at the end and is about 22 feet wide. Its weight is up to 300 pounds and its skeleton is made of cartilage only. It is the largest of all the rays. Manta birostris is found all around the world but especially in tropical and temperate regions close to the shores of America and Africa. There it also finds enough food such as plankton, crustaceans, molluscs as well as small fish. The Manta Ray swims very slowly and often leaps out of the water which is a nice acrobatic spectacle. The rays are sexually mature at the age of 5. There is only a subtle difference between the sexes. The mating process occurs from December till April with gestation lasting over a year. The small young weigh up to 21 pounds and are up to 50 inches wide. Lifespan is 20 years on average.

Megachasma pelagios is a huge shark with a thick body. Its colour is dark grey with lighter colour underside and on the sides. It has got a huge rounded head and a snout. Its hooked teeth are small and there are plenty of them in its large, mega mouth. Its length is approximately 4.5 metres 15 ft. It feeds on small fish, plankton, crustaceans, shrimps etc. It gets the food from pumping and consequently filtering the water with the food. It lives in the midwaters where it finds its food as well. There is no information about its reproduction.

perculaclownfish.php Percula Clownfish  Amphiprion Percula  Percula Clownfish  Percula Clownfish information  Percula Clownfish facts The Clownfish is supposed to be on of the cutest fish in the world. It is approximately 6 cm 2.4 inches long with a weight of only few grams. It has got a typical body shape with a vivid orangewhiteblack coloration. It has got a bright orangebrown body with 3 irregular shaped white stripes. The first one is just behind its eyes whereas the last one is situated on the tail fin. It has got tiny black eyes. It is distributed in western and eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. Understandably these bright fishes can be also found in plenty of aquariums all around the world as well. The spawns can be found on clear corals or rocks. Before the birth both parents take care of the laid eggs. Amphiprion percula has got a very useful and worth symbiosis with the sea anemone. This anemone obtains a huge number of stingy cells. These cells are located on the sea anemone�s tentacles. The cells contain a highly poisonous substance which may cause even death to some fishes. That means that a subtle touch/sting may be lethal for plenty of fishes. Most of the fishes� skin obtains glutathione, which is the aminoacid in the fish�s skin, and this substance triggers the sea anemone�s cells. Fortunately the clownfish lacks this substance therefore they are immune to its stings. In case of emergency or an attack the clownfish hide inside the sea anemone, which protects them. Other fish which are vulnerable to its stings end up their lives as a sea anemone�s food. On the other hand the sea anemone has also got a benefit from the clownfish. They eat food debris located on the anemone�s surface. This debris would be otherwise harmful to the sea anemone because of the bacteria. Besides debris the clownfish also feed on sea plankton.

It is spread in the South America in Guianas and in the Amazon basin. There it inhabits lakes, lagoons and rivers. It has a got silver red colour skin, a blunt head and a quite small mouth. However this mouth contains knifesharp teeth which represent the highest threat of this carnivore fish. It feeds on any kind of meat it finds in the water. On the other hand there are also some Piranha species that feed on fruit and seeds only. The breeding usually occurs during the annual floods and the small young are guarded at the beginning of their lives. Entering the water which contains Piranhas might not be very dangerous when the water level is high enough. However, during the dry season when the water level sinks, it results in extreme danger for swimmers. At this time piranhas create plenty of groups and attack enemy almost immediately. Firstly it was supposed that it is the blood which attracts piranhas. But several studies proved that the water splashing and noise trigger this lethal attack.

triggerfish.php Triggerfish Triggerfish  Triggerfish information  Triggerfish facts The Triggerfishes can be found in tropical shallow waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and the Indian Ocean. It is also found in temperate seas around rocks and reefs. It has got flat deep body with interlocking scales and ratlike sharp teeth. Eyes are moved independently. These fish are not very good swimmers and are considered to be laidback fish e.g.: The Gray Triggerfish Balistes Capriscus or The Reef Triggerfish Rhineantus Aculeatus. When resting these fish rest on their side. On the back there is a typical spiny dorsal fin. The first spine is long and very strong, the second one is smaller and the third one is even smaller. Its diet consists of hardshelled animals, invertebrates, algae also found on the water bottom, worms, crustaceans, snails, eggs, corals, molluscs but also other fish too. Its reproduction is quite typical. The female fish lays eggs which are externally fertilised by the male fish. These eggs remain in nests built by the female parent and are cared for until they hatch. The Triggerfish prefers water temperature ranging from 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It is a favourite aquarium fish. The Reef Triggerfish was voted for the official State Fish of Hawaii in the year 1984.
whaleshark.php Whale Shark  Rhincodon typus  Whale Shark  Whale Shark information  Whale Shark facts The Whale shark is distributed in all tropical seas worldwide. From time to time it was spotted close to the shore. It is about 1220 metres 4065 feet long and weighs over 8 200 kg. In spite of its huge size it does not attack humans. It has got greyish colour with white colour underside. Its flattened head with small eyes and wide mouth create a scary look. Its skin is extremely thick and is also used as a protection. The thickness of its skin is even increased by huge ridges along its back. The Whale shark is a useful indicator for the abundance of other fishes. Therefore many fishermen put nets in the area it stays in. Unfortunately because of its immense size and strength it can be also caught in these nets and destroy many of them in order to escape. Its diet consists of fish and plankton. It pumps the water inside its mouth and this is also the way how Rhincodon typus eats. There is not much known about its breeding and gestation time. The female shark gives birth to small young which are over 60 cm 24 in long. Its life span is over 52 years.

../fish/ Kingdom Animalia; Phylum: Chordata Chordates, Subphylum: Vertebrata Vertebrates Class: Bony Fish Osteichtyes, Pisces The exact number of fishes cannot be specified. There are approximately 22 000 different species and scientists are still sorting them out. Anatomy: Fishes are superbly designed for the water life while water covers about 71 % of the earth�s surface. Their skin is mucous and it is made of scales whose design and shape vary a lot. The majority of fishes have got a skeleton made of bones. The spine is made of vertebrae. Ribs are made from the lateral vertebrae prominences. These ribs stabilize the ventral side and protect inner organs as well. There are tiny bones being created in the paired fins area breast and ventral fins. From the evolutionary point of view, these small bones are a base for future extremities. Apart from that, the breast fins are a base for future shoulderblade and the ventral fins are a base for future pelvic area. It is obvious that neither the shoulderblade area nor the pelvic area are fixed to the spine. Both of them are fixed only to muscles and ligaments. Physiology: The fishes spend their life in the water. They breathe with gills which contain a number of tiny blood vessels and capillaries. These are well protected. Heart of a fish has got two parts: an atrium and a ventricle. The blood from the ventricle flows to an artery which divides into the small ones. These small arteries bring blood to the gills where the blood is oxygenated. Then it flows to the spine artery which divides and subsequently brings blood containing inevitable oxygen to particular organs. Deoxygenated blood from all organs is then collected from all veins to the main one. Last but not least the main vein brings deoxygenated blood to the atrium. This is how blood simply circulates in the fish�s body. Few fishes have got primitive lungs. Digestion is simple as well. Fish�s mouth may contain a huge variety of teeth which kill a prey and crush it. Then it follows to the pharynx and esophagus oesophagus. Distal/Aboral oesophagus part is wider and it is followed by a stomach gaster, ventriculus. Intestine intestinum is not very differentiated. In the ventral esophagus area there is a sack filled with gas. The gas pressure can be changed. The brain consists of five parts. The most peculiar thing about fish is definitely the �sideline�. It is located on the lateral side of the fish�s body. It contains a number of sensory and very sensitive nerves. These nerves enable fish to orientate themselves when it is dark and in murky water. Other sensory organs include eyes, smell organ etc. We can divide fishes into several categories. In the first category there are fishes which live in the fresh water for instance Lepidosiren. They are able to breathe either with gills or with lung sacks as well. The second category contains extinct fishes. Latimera chalumnae is probably the only surviving fish at this time. The third category is a huge one. It contains fishes which inhabits seas and oceans but freshwater as well. Their fins are made of rayshaped bones. In Europe we can find for example: Cyprinus carpio Carp, Tinca tinca, Chondrostoma nasus, Leuciscus cephalus, Salmo Salmon, Essox Pike, Barbus barbus, Perca fluviatilis and so on. The size of the fishes varies a lot. For instance The Whale shark measures up to 19 m whereas the Luzon Goby only 11 mm. Eating habits are different as well. Some fish feed on meat a number of sharks, piranhas whereas other ones feed on plankton, insects etc. carps. Some fish inhabit sea rays and on the other hand there are only freshwater fish such as trout. Apart from that for instance salmons inhabit both types of the water throughout their lives. To put it in a nut shell fishes represent a huge variety of animals which total number still remains unknown and moreover it exceeds the number of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles together.

americantoad.php American Toad  Bufo americanus  American Toad  American Toad information  American Toad facts The American toad is found in North America. They have got round bodies with tail, and smooth skin obtaining defensive chemicals. The dark skin is very thick and darkly spotted. The colour of the skin depends on humidity, temperature and stress. It ranges from yellow to black. Most adult American toads grow up to 5080 mm. They have four short legs with four toes on the front legs. They eat a wide variety of insects, worms, slugs etc. The pray is captured with their wide and sticky tongues or with their front legs. Breeding usually starts in March or April, when temperatures are higher and there are longer days as well. It takes place in ponds, wetlands, lakes and slowmoving streams. The reproduction cycle starts with mating and consequently the female toad lays her eggs up to 25 000 in the water. The male toad releases sperm to fertilize them, this is called external fertilization. After this the parents ignore the eggs. These amphibians can live almost everywhere ranging from fields to forests. They require a freshwater pond or pool for their early development. American toads are active at night especially when the weather is warm. During the day toads hide under rocks, logs or dig into the soil. In winter months American toads dig deeper in order to hibernate. They do not drink water they just absorb it through their skin. The adult toads lose their skin approximately four times a year. Note: Defensive chemicals in a toad�s skin are toxic to human beings therefore it is inevitable to wash one�s hands carefully after touching this animal. In the past they were used as a poison in arrows. On the other hand, these toxins can be used for medical purposes too.

They prefer cool and humid places; however they are not depended on water. Their skin is moist with characteristic black and yellow stripes. His length is up to 15 cm and weights about 15 grams. Salamandra atra is a nocturnal tailed amphibian and most of the day he spends in a shadow. He is sexually mature when reaching the age of 2 years. Salamander female lays eggs and then larval and adult stage follow. The Alpine salamander usually gives birth up to 4 young although much more eggs are fertilised. The explanation is very simple: even small embryos feed themselves also with other developing eggs, which means they are cannibals already in the mother�s body, in uterus. After birth their diet consists of beetles, earthworms, spiders.
californianewt.php California Newt  Taricha torosa  California Newt  California Newt information  California Newt facts Taricha torosa occupies southern parts of the United States. It can be found in the coastline Taricha torosa torosa as well as in the mountain area Taricha torosa sierrae. It is approximately 1420 cm long, whereas males are larger than females. They vary in colour, which ranges from bright brown to dark brown and with yellowish ventral side. The breeding process internal fertilisation is from December till May and usually follows after a �dance ritual�. The California newt prefers dry climate and lives close to ponds, lakes and other water areas. The food they eat consists of insects, slugs, worms, snails, bugs and even their own eggs and larvae. Although they are successful predators, newts are also eaten by a number of animals such as birds, snakes, large spiders, mammals, birds and so on. Therefore they have developed antipredatory mechanisms and defensive behaviour. When threatened they use several weapons how to scare and protect themselves against their enemy. It includes a typical sound, then unique posture with raised head and tail, and last but not least they can excrete a neurotoxin from numerous poison glands in their skin. Their body contains a highly toxic tetrodotoxin, which is harmful to other animal species however not harmful to the newts. This toxin is so powerful, that only 1 drop can kill up to 7 000 mice. The Puffer Fish contain this substance as well.
commonfrog.php Common Frog  Rana Temporaria  Common Frog  Common Frog information  Common Frog facts Rana Temporaria is largely terrestrial; it can be found all over Europe and in some parts of Asia too. It is about 10 cm long and its colour is usually a shade of brown above with blackbrown spots. However, it varies greatly in colour. Its small body with no tail is very firm. Their strong legs are used for swimming as well as for jumping. The Common frog eats insects, spiders, worms and snails. Frogs communicate between one another through typical croaks, which are also the way how males attract females and could be heard far away. The reproduction cycle starts when the male climbs on the female�s back; consequently he releases his sperm on eggs. This external fertilization occurs in water. After mating, frogs leave their eggs and do no take care of them. Rana temporaria is found in damp places, dams, lakes and standing water, although they tend to wander too. In winter they hide in holes in the soil. Frogs are very important animals. On one hand they eat insects including cropdamaging insects on the other hand they are used for carrying out numerous experiments.
darwinsfrog.php Darwin�s frog  Rhinodema darwinii  Darwin�s frog  Darwin�s frog information  Darwin�s frog facts The Darwin�s frog is a tiny frog with length of 2.7 cm and weight of only 2 grams. It has got dark yellow colour with green and brownish spots all over its body. Its skin is moist. Rhinoderma darwinii inhabits cool and shallow streams in moist forests in Latin America, particularly in Chile and Argentine. Its reproduction is quite peculiar. After the female frog lays about 30 eggs the male frog cares for them. When the tadpoles are hatching the male frog takes them with his tongue and places them in his vocal sack. In the vocal sac further development takes place until the tadpoles are about 1 cm long. Consequently they leave the vocal sac and develop themselves outside. Their diet consists of small insects, spiders and earthworms. They are insufficient data about their longevity. The Darwin�s frog was discovered by Charles Darwin when taking his famous Beagle voyage. This unique mouthbrooding is also present on the Australian frog Rheobatrachus silus.

goldenarrowpoisonfrog.php Golden Arrow  poison frog  Dendrobates auratus  Golden Arrow  poison frog  Golden Arrow  poison frog information  Golden Arrow  poison frog facts This poisonous amphibian is spread all around Central and South America. It is very agile with length of 4 cm and weights about 10 grams. It is highly coloured and its yellowblack or greenblack bright colour combinations are also used as a warning to future predators. After mating the female frog lays up to 6 eggs for which the males care and afterwards males carry tadpoles on their back because of the safety reasons. They live approximately 3 years. They feed on tiny invertebrates and small insects. Dendrobates auratus generally inhabits tropical forests close to water resources. As it has been already mentioned the Golden Arrow  poison frog is a highly toxic one. Its skin glands produce toxic substance when only 0.00001 g of this venom can kill a human. In ancient times Indians had pierced these amphibians with a long, thin stick and heated them over a fire. Consequently small drops of the poison appeared on the skin�s surface and arrows were dipped into that. Such arrows were then used to paralyse hunted animals.

It is found in rain forests in the southeastern parts of Africa particularly often on isolated places. The Golden mantilla searches for food throughout the day, which consists of insects e.g.: ants, worms, termites and so on. The external fertilization is typical for them and occurs in damp places always close to the water. Its highlyvisible coloration is used as a natural protection against predators, because it may imitate some toxic species.

It is approximately 10 cm long and weights about 80 grams. It has got moist skin, strong and long limbs just appropriate for swimming in fastflowing streams. Its colour may vary from brown to olive green with yellow spots. It also has very powerful fingers and toes with claws in order to catch prey. These claws are also very useful for climbing on smooth surfaces as well as for defence. Despite its name, there is no hair at all on this frog. On both sides of the body there are hairlike filaments which are in fact vascular papillae that are most notable during the breeding season. They may have several functions including the respiratory one. However Astylosternus robustus uses lungs for breathing as well. After mating, spawns and eggs are found in water while eggs are usually on the underside of stones. The Hairy frog lives up to 5 years. These frogs feed on small invertebrates including snails and small mammals using their strong limbs with sharp claws.
hochstettersfrog.php Hochstetter�s Frog  Leiopelma hochstetteri  Hochstetter�s Frog  Hochstetter�s Frog information  Hochstetter�s Frog facts Leiopelma hochsteteri is one of three native amphibians found and still present in New Zealand. Some species can be found in the North America too. The Hochstetter�s frog gets its name after an Austrian naturalist who in 1858 visited New Zealand and described these strange and from the evolution point of view very old frogs. They are dark browncoloured with rough skin, about 4.5 cm long and weight approximately 8g. They do have tailwagging muscles despite no tail is visible. This also indicates that tails were evolutionary developed later on. His natural habitat includes damp forests and cold streams with the temperature of about 4�C. His development cycle is very remarkable. It begins with an egg, consequently tadpole metamorphosis takes place in the egg too and eggremains altogether with tiny insects are part of his diet. When mature he feeds with insects, crustacea and spiders. All in all the Hochstetter�s frog is a unique old amphibian which truly deserves to be a protected one.
hornedtoads.php Horned Toads  e.g.: Phrynosoma douglasii  Horned Toads  Horned Toads information  Horned Toads facts These lizards are not toads in the true meaning of this word, however they look very similar. They are distributed in the western parts of the North America and Canada. Their bodies are flat, with the ability to inflate, have short tail and are up to 14 cm long with the weight of 30g. As their name says they have got horns or spines, which are used as an effective defensive mechanism. They are grey or brown with dark spots all over their bodies. Moreover they have got a great ability to change colour of their skin in order to match their current environment. Their diet consists mostly of insects, ants, worms etc. Generally they inhabit dry places such as deserts, sandy areas, but they could be found in fields as well. The process of reproduction varies a lot. Some species lay eggs whereas other ones give birth to live young. In case of emergency they have perfect defensive mechanisms. Firstly, they are able to change their skin colour which makes them almost invisible to the predators, secondly can inflate themselves, jump and hiss. Then they can eject blood from their eyes, which makes them look very scary. Last but not least they can use their horns and spines to perforate predator�s guts when digested.

paradoxicalfrog.php Paradoxical frog  Pseudis paradoxus  Paradoxical frog  Paradoxical frog information  Paradoxical frog facts The Paradoxical frog gets its name because of the length contrast between the tadpole and the adult frog. At the tadpole stage Pseudis paradoxus is up to 20 cm long and even 25 cm long species were described. On the other hand the adult frog is only about 6 cm long. No scientist can fullyexplain a benefit from this shrinking process throughout the frog�s development. Pseudis paradocus is green coloured with dark green / olive stripes. It inhabits ponds, lakes and lagoons in Trinidad and Amazon. The female frog lays eggs among water plants which develop into giant tadpoles. These paradoxical amphibians feed on larvae, small insects and tiny invertebrates. The paradoxical frog is a nocturnal animal and spends most of its life in water. On the bottom he finds his food. When threatened he uses his strong toes with an extra joint in order to stir up the muddy bottom and hide. This is also the way how to find some food on the bottom of the lakes.
rainfrog.php Rain Frog  Breviceps adspersus  Rain Frog  Rain Frog information  Rain Frog facts The rain frog is spread in southern parts of Africa. He is about 5.5 cm long and his weight is up to 5 grams. He has got spotty skin that is brown coloured with cream coloured spots and white dots. Brevis adspersus spends most of his life on dry places including deserts, which is quite unusual for a frog. Most of the day he is hidden underground and sometimes can be seen above the ground, especially after the rain. Although this amphibian is able to walk and run, he cannot hop which is also another exception among the frogs. He is even not able to swim which means he can be easily drowned in water. The only way how he can save himself from drowning is to inflate his body and float to the bank. The female frog lays up to 40 eggs in the jelly. These eggs are laid in moist soil or sand and the frog�s development takes place in here until the complete metamorphosis is done. The Rain frog gets his nutrition from insects, earthworms, termites and small spiders.

It has got an olive colour, robust body, rough skin and long tail. He can measure up to 30 cm and weight approximately 20g. His lifeexpectancy is up to 20 years. He eats a number of small invertebrates. He is a nocturnal animal and lives in rivers, where water is slowmoving, then ponds, lakes and ditches understandably he is a good swimmer too. Ribs are the most fascinating thing about this salamander. They are very strong, sharp and in fact they do stick through the salamander�s skin when threatened. It is a perfect perforating weapon and a great defensive mechanism against some natural predators such as snakes or several fish.
southafricansharpnosedfrog.php South African Sharpnosed Frog  Ptychadena oxyrhynchus  South African Sharpnosed Frog  South African Sharpnosed Frog information  South African Sharpnosed Frog facts As its name already reveals, the South African sharpnosed frog is mainly found in South Africa however it is also spread in the central parts of this continent. Males measure up to 5.5 cm and females up to 6.6 cm. Its weight ranges from 25 to 30 grams. Its moist skin has got yellowishgreenish colour with brown stripes along its body and nose is sharpshaped. Breeding cycle begins right after the start of the rainy season and occurs in still, slowmoving water or temporary pools. During mating the frogs have to be aware of an attack from a number of natural predators. Life expectancy is probably around 5 years. Its diet is rather typical for a frog and consists of small invertebrates, spiders however mainly insects. A special feature which makes this frog so special is its overwhelming jumping ability. Only in three jumps it is able to overcome almost 10 meters distance that is over 150 times its own body length! This is possible thank to the agile body and predominantly strong and long limbs and its aerodynamicshaped body note: sharpshaped nose decreases the air resistance.
southerntoad.php Southern Toad  Bufo terrestris  Southern Toad  Southern Toad information  Southern Toad facts The Southern toad is located from North Caroline to Florida and west to the Mississippi River. From the physical point of view it is a mediumsized toad with the length ranging from 40 to 90 mm, while females are generally larger. As a typical characteristic of the family Bufonidae the skin is warty and spotted and parotid glands are present too. Dorsal coloration can vary from red to black. As usual, the ventral side is lighter. The Southern toad generally eats a variety of insects and invertebrates. Breeding is usually located on ponds edges, woodland pools and dams. The eggs up to 3000 are laid in long coils of jelly by a female toad. Bufo terrestris is active mainly during the night. At daylight these amphibians are hiding in burrows. The chorus of the Southern toad is very loud and can be heard at a long distance away. The southern toad is found on fields, sandy areas and hammocks. It is supposed, that toads can climb.
surinamtoad.php Surinam Toad  Pipa pipa  Surinam Toad  Surinam Toad information  Surinam Toad facts The Surinam toad is found in Brazil and Guianas. He is about 20 cm long with the weight of between 100 � 160 g. He has got flat body and quite frightening dark brown or grey coloured rough skin. His front legs are extremely strong and enable him to eat the prey with his wide mouth. His eyes are very small, so it is considered that they are almost useless. His breeding cycle is very fascinating. It starts with laying up to 60 eggs afterwards these eggs are placed in chambers on the female�s back, which involves pretty remarkable underwater acrobatic movements. The female�s back is used as an incubator, where the eggs change to tadpoles, followed by their metamorphosis. Pipa Pipa is strictly aquatic and lives on bottom in slowmoving waters including ponds, lakes or even rivers. There he feeds himself with invertebrates, insects, larvae and worms. Although he does not have neither teeth nor tongue his wide mouth is so strong that he is able to eat even small fish.
tigersalamander.php Tiger Salamander  Ambystoma tigrinum  Tiger Salamander  Tiger Salamander information  Tiger Salamander facts Ambystoma tigrinum gets its name because of a stripped pattern. It is approximately 1530 cm long. It has got brownish colour with black and yellow spots. The Tiger Salamander is spread almost all over the United States, in southern parts of Canada and in Mexico. It inhabits dry areas, forests, deserts etc. His diet consists of worms, insects, snails, larvae and moreover he is a cannibal too, which means he eats other salamanders as well. The reproduction cycle begins in March or April in wet areas such as ponds, pools and lakes. After insemination a female salamander lays eggs at night. This is a critical point, because salamanders have to defend the eggs. Their life expectancy is up to 15 years. There are plenty of granular glands in the salamanders� skin. Firstly, they produce a substance, which could be toxic to other animals. Secondly, they secrete mucus to keep salamanders� skin moist. Through their skin the tiger salamanders absorb water too. Throughout their development cycle salamanders are a good prey for animals such as fish, birds, snakes, owls and frogs too.
tomatofrog.php Tomato Frog  Dyscophus antongilli  Tomato Frog  Tomato Frog information  Tomato Frog facts These endangered frogs have got a bright orange coloration, which is used as a protection against natural predators. This colour warning mechanism is also used by the Golden mantella. Dyscophus antongilli are sexually dimorphic and measure from 810 cm, while females are larger than males. They occupy damp places such as swamps, pools, lakes, rivers, shallow water or even some lowlands in Madagascar. They get their nutrition from water, larvae, insects etc. generally during the night. The breeding process takes place mainly during cold months and their life expectancy is approximately 10 years. Humanbeings should be aware, that in danger frog�s skin secretes a toxic substance to which some people may be allergic. After touching this amphibian, hands should be washed very carefully.
treefrogs.php Tree Frogs Tree Frogs  Tree Frogs information  Tree Frogs facts In this group belong over 500 different species located all around the world apart from Antarctica. Their size varies from 1.5 cm Least Tree Frog / Hyla ocularis  to 10 cm Hyla vasta. They have got a typical bright green coloration with white or yellow ventral stripes, which may vary. Tree frogs have strong and long legs, which enable them to climb, jump and make them very agile. They are able to cling thank to adhesive pads, walk on narrow branches, catch the prey as well as jump up to 40 times their own length. They hunt for food especially during night, which consists of insects and other small invertebrales. Reproduction cycle mainly depends on weather conditions. Males start to croak and call in order to attract females. Then the female lays eggs, the male fertilizes them with the seminal fluid. This occurs from mid April till mid August. Frogs inhabit almost all areas that are not very far from water lakes, pools, freshwater rivers, bushes, rainforests etc.. They usually rest during the day and as the evening comes they start with typical noisy choruses. The chorus is interrupted by some intervals of silence and can be heard in long distances especially by the water.

Moist skin usually has a brown colour with dark spots, however colours may vary grey, green etc. There is a white stripe together with brown stripe located above the upper lip, which is a characteristic feature. His diet consists of small invertebrates such as flies, beetles, ants, spiders, leaf hoppers and so on. Its breeding cycle begins in the middle of March and lasts till the end of May. Breeding process and laying eggs occur in the areas that are close to the water for instance: ponds, lakes, swamps and flooded places and are accompanied by characteristic �breeding choruses�. Water area is also the place where the Western Chorus Frog spends most of his life. Pseudacris triseriata is also an environmental marker, because behaviour changes as well as colour change may indicate a certain level of pollution.

../fish/ Kingdom Animalia; Phylum: Chordata Chordates, Subphylum: Vertebrata Vertebrates Class: Bony Fish Osteichtyes, Pisces The exact number of fishes cannot be specified. There are approximately 22 000 different species and scientists are still sorting them out. Anatomy: Fishes are superbly designed for the water life while water covers about 71 % of the earth�s surface. Their skin is mucous and it is made of scales whose design and shape vary a lot. The majority of fishes have got a skeleton made of bones. The spine is made of vertebrae. Ribs are made from the lateral vertebrae prominences. These ribs stabilize the ventral side and protect inner organs as well. There are tiny bones being created in the paired fins area breast and ventral fins. From the evolutionary point of view, these small bones are a base for future extremities. Apart from that, the breast fins are a base for future shoulderblade and the ventral fins are a base for future pelvic area. It is obvious that neither the shoulderblade area nor the pelvic area are fixed to the spine. Both of them are fixed only to muscles and ligaments. Physiology: The fishes spend their life in the water. They breathe with gills which contain a number of tiny blood vessels and capillaries. These are well protected. Heart of a fish has got two parts: an atrium and a ventricle. The blood from the ventricle flows to an artery which divides into the small ones. These small arteries bring blood to the gills where the blood is oxygenated. Then it flows to the spine artery which divides and subsequently brings blood containing inevitable oxygen to particular organs. Deoxygenated blood from all organs is then collected from all veins to the main one. Last but not least the main vein brings deoxygenated blood to the atrium. This is how blood simply circulates in the fish�s body. Few fishes have got primitive lungs. Digestion is simple as well. Fish�s mouth may contain a huge variety of teeth which kill a prey and crush it. Then it follows to the pharynx and esophagus oesophagus. Distal/Aboral oesophagus part is wider and it is followed by a stomach gaster, ventriculus. Intestine intestinum is not very differentiated. In the ventral esophagus area there is a sack filled with gas. The gas pressure can be changed. The brain consists of five parts. The most peculiar thing about fish is definitely the �sideline�. It is located on the lateral side of the fish�s body. It contains a number of sensory and very sensitive nerves. These nerves enable fish to orientate themselves when it is dark and in murky water. Other sensory organs include eyes, smell organ etc. We can divide fishes into several categories. In the first category there are fishes which live in the fresh water for instance Lepidosiren. They are able to breathe either with gills or with lung sacks as well. The second category contains extinct fishes. Latimera chalumnae is probably the only surviving fish at this time. The third category is a huge one. It contains fishes which inhabits seas and oceans but freshwater as well. Their fins are made of rayshaped bones. In Europe we can find for example: Cyprinus carpio Carp, Tinca tinca, Chondrostoma nasus, Leuciscus cephalus, Salmo Salmon, Essox Pike, Barbus barbus, Perca fluviatilis and so on. The size of the fishes varies a lot. For instance The Whale shark measures up to 19 m whereas the Luzon Goby only 11 mm. Eating habits are different as well. Some fish feed on meat a number of sharks, piranhas whereas other ones feed on plankton, insects etc. carps. Some fish inhabit sea rays and on the other hand there are only freshwater fish such as trout. Apart from that for instance salmons inhabit both types of the water throughout their lives. To put it in a nut shell fishes represent a huge variety of animals which total number still remains unknown and moreover it exceeds the number of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles together.

This bird is approximately 70 cm long 28 in and weighs over 1.7 kg 3.6 lb. It has got dark coloured feathers which are a great camouflage in the dens forests it lives in. Its small head and flexible but short neck have got reddish colour. Its legs are rather strong and have claws. These enable it to find food on the ground. Alectura lathami generally lives in wet forests and in rainforests. There it feed on insects, seeds, tiny larvae but also fruit. Breeding is done with the eggs. There are about 30 eggs laid by the female. These eggs are stored in a huge pill of small branches and leaves. This pile measures 1 3.3 feet meter in width and about 3 metres in length. It is used as an incubator and the male turkey checks out the inner temperature by putting its head in the pile. The leaves in the damp forests produce the heat which is consequently used to incubate the eggs. Small chicken do not have any �egg tooth� in order to break out of the egg. So they have to help themselves by using their strong legs. After the birth these tiny chicken are fully developed so they are already full feathered and able to fly! The Australian Brush Turkey usually lives approximately 25 years.

../fish/ Kingdom Animalia; Phylum: Chordata Chordates, Subphylum: Vertebrata Vertebrates Class: Bony Fish Osteichtyes, Pisces The exact number of fishes cannot be specified. There are approximately 22 000 different species and scientists are still sorting them out. Anatomy: Fishes are superbly designed for the water life while water covers about 71 % of the earth�s surface. Their skin is mucous and it is made of scales whose design and shape vary a lot. The majority of fishes have got a skeleton made of bones. The spine is made of vertebrae. Ribs are made from the lateral vertebrae prominences. These ribs stabilize the ventral side and protect inner organs as well. There are tiny bones being created in the paired fins area breast and ventral fins. From the evolutionary point of view, these small bones are a base for future extremities. Apart from that, the breast fins are a base for future shoulderblade and the ventral fins are a base for future pelvic area. It is obvious that neither the shoulderblade area nor the pelvic area are fixed to the spine. Both of them are fixed only to muscles and ligaments. Physiology: The fishes spend their life in the water. They breathe with gills which contain a number of tiny blood vessels and capillaries. These are well protected. Heart of a fish has got two parts: an atrium and a ventricle. The blood from the ventricle flows to an artery which divides into the small ones. These small arteries bring blood to the gills where the blood is oxygenated. Then it flows to the spine artery which divides and subsequently brings blood containing inevitable oxygen to particular organs. Deoxygenated blood from all organs is then collected from all veins to the main one. Last but not least the main vein brings deoxygenated blood to the atrium. This is how blood simply circulates in the fish�s body. Few fishes have got primitive lungs. Digestion is simple as well. Fish�s mouth may contain a huge variety of teeth which kill a prey and crush it. Then it follows to the pharynx and esophagus oesophagus. Distal/Aboral oesophagus part is wider and it is followed by a stomach gaster, ventriculus. Intestine intestinum is not very differentiated. In the ventral esophagus area there is a sack filled with gas. The gas pressure can be changed. The brain consists of five parts. The most peculiar thing about fish is definitely the �sideline�. It is located on the lateral side of the fish�s body. It contains a number of sensory and very sensitive nerves. These nerves enable fish to orientate themselves when it is dark and in murky water. Other sensory organs include eyes, smell organ etc. We can divide fishes into several categories. In the first category there are fishes which live in the fresh water for instance Lepidosiren. They are able to breathe either with gills or with lung sacks as well. The second category contains extinct fishes. Latimera chalumnae is probably the only surviving fish at this time. The third category is a huge one. It contains fishes which inhabits seas and oceans but freshwater as well. Their fins are made of rayshaped bones. In Europe we can find for example: Cyprinus carpio Carp, Tinca tinca, Chondrostoma nasus, Leuciscus cephalus, Salmo Salmon, Essox Pike, Barbus barbus, Perca fluviatilis and so on. The size of the fishes varies a lot. For instance The Whale shark measures up to 19 m whereas the Luzon Goby only 11 mm. Eating habits are different as well. Some fish feed on meat a number of sharks, piranhas whereas other ones feed on plankton, insects etc. carps. Some fish inhabit sea rays and on the other hand there are only freshwater fish such as trout. Apart from that for instance salmons inhabit both types of the water throughout their lives. To put it in a nut shell fishes represent a huge variety of animals which total number still remains unknown and moreover it exceeds the number of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles together.

In comparison to the Asian Elephant, the African Elephant has got 2 finger tips whereas the Asian Elephant has got only one. African elephants usually live in small groups which are led by an older female elephant. The males prefer a solitary life meeting up with the females only for the sake of mating. Mating occurs all year long with the gestation period of approximately 2 years. One calf is born afterwards. These days Loxodonta Africana belongs to the endangered species. Their main threat is still poaching. Poachers hunt them because of their ivory tusks. Unfortunately their natural habitat is also getting smaller, which is another important reason of their small living numbers in the world.
